Yesterday, I have released a new Chrome extension named "goo.gl URL Shortener extension".

[
[goo.gl URL Shortener extension](http://goo.gl/sXx5k)] - Chrome web store.

I usually use a goo.gl service. But there are some problems while using the service as me:

* I want to change the long URL to the short URL quickly without visiting the goo.gl service page.

* I want to post to Twitter with the short URL quickly.

* I want to check the click count of the URL posted to Twitter, G+ and so on as soon as possible without visiting the go.gl service page.

I thought these requests will be solved by developing a new Chrome extension. You (at least and I) can retrieve the short URL you want and tweet continuously, and check the change history with the click count using this extension quickly.

Try it and feel free to let me know your feedback!
